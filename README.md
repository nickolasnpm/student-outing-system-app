# Student Outing System 

## The app is my mini project when attending the Android Mobile Application Development course at Center for Technology Excellence, Sarawak. 

This app was built to assist the Student Affair Department to monitor the movement - in and out of their student throughout the week. 
The record is important to ensure the student safety is at the highest level. The project is a perfect opportunity for me to learn on how to do the following;

* create a functioning android mobile application using Java, XML, and SQL
* create a comprehensive application and integrate it with Google Firebase as database 
* create an app that enable the admin (Student Affair Department's personnel) to communicate - receive and respond (approve or disapprove) to the application - with the general users (students)
